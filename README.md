## Visualization Tool

You can run the example studies on [Equity Visualization Tool](https://miao-qi-rpi-app.shinyapps.io/EquityBrowser/).

1. Measure inequity in randomized clinical trials
2. Visualize inequity for subgroups
3. Compare inequities among studies

The R codes are available in the folder Visualization Codes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:
1. A software/server that can run R shiny codes


## Example RCTs
We apply the proposed RCT equity metrics to three landmark clinical trials released in the last decade: Action to ControlCardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD), Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart AttackTrial(ALLHAT), and Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). All patient data are obtained through the [BiologicSpecimen and Data Repositories Information Coordinating Center (BioLINCC)](https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/home/).
